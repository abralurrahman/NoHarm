# NoHarm Survey Project Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through setting up and running the NoHarm survey web application. To create a virtual environment, install necessary dependencies, run the server, and view survey results.

## Prerequisites

- **Python**: Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed. Download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **pip**: Pythonâ€™s package installer, included with Python.

## Step 1: Setting Up the Virtual Environment

1. Open Command Prompt or Terminal.
2. Navigate to your desired directory where you want to set up the project:
    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/project/directory
    ```
3. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
    - **Windows (PowerShell)**:
      ```bash
      .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
      ```
    - **Windows (CMD)**:
      ```cmd
      .\venv\Scripts\activate
      ```
    - **Mac/Linux**:
      ```bash
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```

   When activated, you should see `(venv)` at the beginning of your command prompt.

## Step 2: Installing Flask and Dependencies

1. Install Flask using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install Flask
    ```
2. Verify the Flask installation:
    ```bash
    flask --version
    ```
   You should see the Flask version information confirming the installation.

## Step 3: Setting Up the Project Structure

1. Create the project directory if not already done:
    ```bash
    mkdir NoHarm
    cd NoHarm
    ```
2. Inside the `NoHarm` directory, ensure you have the following structure:
    - `app.py` for the Flask application.
    - `templates/index.html` for the survey form.
    - `templates/results.html` for displaying the survey results.

## Step 4: Initializing the SQLite Database

1. Create a script (`init_db.py`) to initialize the database.
2. Run the script to create the database and tables:
    ```bash
    python init_db.py
    ```
   This creates a `database.db` file with the necessary tables for storing survey responses.

## Step 5: Running the Flask Server

1. Start the Flask app:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
2. Open your web browser and navigate to:
    ```
    http://127.0.0.1:5000/
    ```
   This URL is specific to your local machine and indicates that the server is running locally. It will open the homepage where you can fill out and submit the survey.

   **Note:** The URL `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` is a loopback address that points to your own computer. This means each developer will use the same address to access their own local instance of the server. Since we haven't deployed this application to a public server yet, the address may change once we have a dedicated server.

## Step 6: Viewing Survey Results

1. After submitting a survey response, view the stored data by navigating to:
    ```
    http://127.0.0.1:5000/results
    ```
2. This page displays a table with all the survey responses collected on your local instance.

   **Note:** The data displayed here will only include responses submitted on your own machine. If other developers are running the app on their machines, they will see their own set of responses.
